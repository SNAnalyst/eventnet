Data on interaction events in international relations.

**Gulf data** the file [gulf_events.zip](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/raw/master/data/ir/gulf_events.zip) (file size 18MB; uncompressed file size 200MB) contains daily interaction events among state actors (sovereign countries) related with the Persian Gulf region from 1979 to 1999. Interaction events are typed by [WEIS codes](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/5211) and have associated weights ranging from -10 to +10, where a negative weight indicates hostile/conflictive interaction and a positive weight indicates friendly/cooperative interaction. The interaction events have been extracted from news reports by the [Computational Event Data System](http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/). Additionally, the file contains exogenous covariates (among others encoding geographic proximity of countries, trade, alliances, and capability scores) provided by the [Correlates of War project](http://www.correlatesofwar.org/); some of these exogenous covariates change by the year.
